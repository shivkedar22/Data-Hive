As cities become more crowded and consumer expectations for quick delivery times rise, the need for streamlined and technology-enabled logistics solutions has surged. Companies are investing in advanced supply chain technologies, including AI, real-time tracking, and automation, to enhance their operations and meet customer demand. Moreover, the rise of on-demand delivery services, last-mile delivery solutions, and the adoption of electric vehicles are contributing significantly to the market's expansion.
